# TenderHawk — project context

AI web agents that find the Indian government tenders a small business can actually win, and tell it why.
Built at **HackIIITD 2026** (24h in-person final at IIITD) by team **L.C Hard, JIIT Noida**.
**TinyFish API integration is mandatory** and must be the core of the product, not a bolt-on.

## Problem
- GeM procured ~₹5 lakh Cr in FY 2025–26; 25% of central procurement is reserved for MSEs by policy; 11 lakh+ MSEs are on GeM.
- Tenders are scattered: GeM, CPPP, IREPS, defence, ~30 state e-procurement portals, each with its own UI, filters, captchas.
- Eligibility (turnover, past experience, EMD, certifications) is buried in long bid PDFs.
- Hard deadlines; corrigenda (extensions, changed terms) get posted quietly.
- Owners check portals at night or pay consultants ₹5–20k/month.

## Solution (4 steps)
1. **Profile once** — products, HSN codes, annual turnover, certifications (MSE/Udyam, Startup India, ISO), states served.
2. **Agents sweep portals** — TinyFish Agent API opens each portal, filters, paginates, returns bids as JSON.
3. **Read & match** — Fetch API pulls bid documents as text; LLM extracts eligibility into structured JSON with the source clause; rules check hard criteria; embeddings rank product fit.
4. **Alert & act** — WhatsApp/email: tender, value, deadline, verdict, reasons, document checklist, link to source clause.

Verdicts: `ELIGIBLE` (green) / `CHECK_DOCS` (amber) / `NOT_ELIGIBLE` with reason e.g. "Turnover short" (red).

Differentiators: reads eligibility not keywords; one profile across every portal; every verdict shows the exact clause.

## Users & pricing (pitch only, don't build billing)
- Primary: MSMEs & startups. Channel: CA firms & tender consultants (multi-client). Ecosystem: incubators, MSME associations.
- Free (1 category, weekly) / Pro ₹999/mo (all categories, daily) / Consultant ₹4,999/mo (25 clients).

## Architecture
```
Sources (GeM, CPPP, Haryana e-proc)
  -> TinyFish layer (Agent: navigate+extract | Fetch: bid docs->text | Search: corrigenda)
  -> Processing (Pydantic validate + dedupe on bid_no | LLM eligibility parser | embeddings)
  -> Store (Postgres: tenders, profiles, matches | pgvector: embeddings)
  -> Serve (Matcher: rules + rank | FastAPI: REST + SSE)
  -> Users (Next.js dashboard with live agent panel | Twilio WhatsApp + email alerts)
```
**Invariant: TinyFish is the only component that touches the live web. Everything downstream works on validated JSON.**

## TinyFish usage
- **Agent API** — core crawler, goal-based run per portal × category, `/run-async` + `/run-sse` (stream steps to UI). Billed: use only on listing sweeps, never per user.
- **Fetch API** (`api.fetch.tinyfish.ai`) — once per new bid, renders page/docs to clean text for the LLM. No credits.
- **Search API** (`api.search.tinyfish.ai`) — daily per active bid: corrigenda, deadline extensions, buyer context. No credits.
- **Browser API** — phase 2 only (bid-status tracking). Do not build now.

```python
from tinyfish import TinyFish
client = TinyFish()  # reads TINYFISH_API_KEY
run = client.agent.run(
    url="https://bidplus.gem.gov.in/all-bids",
    goal="Search bids for 'steel rack'. Keep only bids closing after today. "
         "Return bid_no, item, ministry, quantity, end_date, doc_url as JSON.")
```
Check the installed SDK for exact method names/signatures before assuming; adapt the wrapper, not callers.

## Hackathon scope (24h) — decided, don't expand
- Portals: **GeM, CPPP, Haryana e-proc** only.
- Scheduler: FastAPI background tasks / APScheduler + Redis pub/sub for SSE. **No Celery** (mention as scale path only).
- WhatsApp: **Twilio sandbox**, not Meta Cloud API.
- pgvector: one embedding per tender, one per profile, cosine rank.
- **FALLBACK_MODE**: recorded real agent runs in `delivery/fixtures/*.json`; when `FALLBACK_MODE=true`, sweeps replay fixtures (still emitting SSE steps with small delays) so the demo survives bad wifi/portal downtime.
- Captcha/blocked portals: skip and surface a direct link. **Never bypass captchas.** Read-only: never submit bids.

## Stack
Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic, psycopg, Pydantic v2, Redis, PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector, TinyFish SDK, LLM with structured output, PyMuPDF (+ OCR fallback), Next.js + Tailwind, Twilio, Docker Compose.

## Repo layout & ownership
```
agents/     TinyFish client wrapper, portal goals, schemas, SSE step events   (Siddhant — lead)
api/        FastAPI app, models, migrations, eligibility parser, matcher      (Harsh)
web/        Next.js dashboard: profile form, live agents panel, matches, detail (Aditya)
delivery/   Twilio/email alerts, seed profiles, fixtures, fallback mode, docker (Vandan)
```

## Core data model (starting point)
- `Tender`: id, portal, bid_no (unique with portal), title, item, ministry/buyer, quantity, est_value, end_date, doc_url, doc_text, eligibility (JSONB), embedding, corrigenda (JSONB), created_at, updated_at
- `Eligibility` JSON: `min_turnover`, `past_experience_years`, `emd_amount`, `emd_exemption_for_mse`, `required_certifications[]`, `states[]`, each criterion with `source_clause` text
- `Profile`: id, name, phone, products[], hsn_codes[], annual_turnover, years_in_business, certifications[], states_served[], embedding
- `Match`: profile_id, tender_id, verdict, reasons[], missing_docs[], fit_score, alerted_at

## Demo (3 min) — everything serves this
1. Create a business profile (persona: **Ramesh**, 25-person steel fabrication unit, Faridabad, Udyam + GeM registered).
2. Hit **"Sweep now"** → live agents panel shows GeM / CPPP / Haryana / Search-corrigenda runs with step counts.
3. Open a match → verdict + highlighted source clause.
4. WhatsApp alert lands on stage.
Example match: "Supply of steel storage racks · MoD · ₹18.5 L · closes 28 Oct · Eligible: turnover met, MSE EMD exemption applies · Check: needs 3 years past-supply proof."

## Timeline & checkpoints (merge to main at each)
- H0–4: skeleton, TinyFish goals for 3 portals, schemas, first live GeM run saved to fixtures
- H4–10: Postgres upsert/dedupe, /sweep endpoint, Fetch for docs, SSE streaming, profile form
- H10–16: LLM eligibility extraction, matcher, embeddings, Search corrigenda, **fixtures recorded by H12**
- H16–21: WhatsApp alert, match detail UI, error states → tag `v0.1-demo`
- H21–24: **fix-only freeze**, README, rehearse live + fallback

## Git rules
- `main` always demo-able. Branches: `feat/agents`, `feat/backend`, `feat/web`, `feat/delivery`.
- Small commits every 30–60 min, conventional commits: `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `chore:`, `docs:`. Scopes: agents, api, web, delivery.
- One logical change per commit. Never commit `.env` or secrets.
- Don't push unless asked.

## How to work in this repo
- Keep it simple and demo-first; no premature abstraction, no features outside scope.
- Validate every agent output with Pydantic; one retry on validation failure, then log and skip.
- Config from env vars only (see `.env.example`).
- When finishing a task: run it, show it works, then commit with the message given (or propose one).
